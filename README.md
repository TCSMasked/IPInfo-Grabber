# IPInfo Grabber - Open Source
What Is "IPInfo Grabber"? Well, long story short. When I first started off coding in Python as I assume everyone else did, I created scripts that are "pointless" but a good starting point to a langauge like Python.
## Language Information
IPInfo Grabber is implemented in Python using mainly the requests package. The choice of Python as the programming language empowers the project with a rich set of features. However, to ensure seamless operation and access to all the functionalities, additional packages are required.
## Setup & Installation
To set up and install IPInfo Grabber, please follow the steps below:
- Ensure that you have a fairly recent version of Python installed on your system.

- Download a stable release of the IPInfo Grabber from this repository.

- Open a Terminal or Command Prompt in the same directory as the "main.py" file.

- Execute the following command to install the required dependencies:

    `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once all the requirements have been successfully downloaded and installed, you can proceed with the actual setup of IPInfo Grabber. Open the "main.py" file in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I have provided a comprehensive set of rules, instructions, and labels in the file, which are commented for better understanding.

Ensure that you fill out all the required information in the Configuration Vars section accurately, as indicated in the comments. Once you have completed the configuration, you are ready to use the script.

To use the script, simply run or open the "main.py" file in a Python terminal.

## FAQ

#### Is This Legal?

For me, yes it is. However, I would suggest doing some research about your cyber-laws in your area beforehand.

#### Am I Able To Use Any IPv4 Address?

Yes, this does not have an "IP Blacklist". Any real public IPv4 address will return some sort of data back.
